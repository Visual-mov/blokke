Blokke is a open source Tetris clone with a green & blue aesthetic. It includes most core features and mechanics of Tetris, such as a holding function and scoring system. I built Blokke as a way to get familiar with Unity.

## Running
Clone repo:
```
~$ git clone https://github.com/Visual-mov/blokke
```

Navigate to `blokke/Builds`, and select the file for your platform. Currently only Windows is supported.

## Controls
The controls for Blokke are also included in the "About" menu. Blokke supports keyboard or control pad for input.
